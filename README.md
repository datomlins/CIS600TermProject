# CIS600TermProject

This package exists to support DataAnalysis.Rmd. 

MLP_OPS.ipynb is a python notebook which contains the code to build the majority of the models. The models can be rerun
dynamically with essentially no input from a user. To build the models with the maximum dimensionality reduction, 
uncomment or comment the appropriate lines as necessary.

RFAnalysis.Rmd is the R notebook for experimentation with building models of Random Forest.

svm_model.Rmd is the R notebook for consturcting the SVM models.

The remaining files are reserved for future use.
