Import necessary libraries.

```{r}

# install_keras() - don't want to install keras until we've determined
# we want to use it because keras is quite large.

library(readr)
library(data.table)
library(TermDataAnalysis)
# library(keras)


```

Then, we can import the data.

```{r}
onlineShopperData <- fread("data/online_shoppers_intention.csv")
data_processed <- copy(onlineShopperData)
```


Pre-process the data
```{r}

# First we trim the columns we don't need at all
data_processed <- stripUseless(onlineShopperData, c("OperatingSystems", 
                    "Browser", "Administrative", "Informational", 
                    "ProductRelated"))

# Then we combine the columsn that we think we can combine
# WARNING: The generalization for this function isn't set up yet TODO
data_processed <- proportionalize(onlineShopperData, "ProductRelated_Duration", c("Administrative_Duration", "Informational_Duration", "ProductRelated_Duration"))

```
