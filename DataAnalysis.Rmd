Before doing any data analysis, we need to be able to import our data. To do 
that we need to install "readr". This will let us import the data from the csv.

```{r}
install.packages("readr")
library(readr)

' 
In case we use neural networks (we probably will). Not including because the
  library is quite large.
install.packages("keras")
install_keras()
library(keras)
'

```

Then, we can import the data.

```{r}
onlineShopperData <- read.csv("online_shoppers_intention.csv")
```

This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Ctrl+Shift+Enter*. 

```{r}
plot(cars)
```

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Ctrl+Alt+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Ctrl+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file).

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.

*** TODO *** Write documentation for the data
*** TODO *** fix the file structure for an R project
