Import necessary libraries.

```{r}

# install_keras() - don't want to install keras until we've determined
# we want to use it because keras is quite large.

library(readr)
library(data.table)
# library(keras)


```

Then, we can import the data.

```{r}
onlineShopperData <- fread("data/online_shoppers_intention.csv")
```



*** TODO *** Write documentation for the data
