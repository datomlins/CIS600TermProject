Import necessary libraries.

```{r}

# install_keras() - don't want to install keras until we've determined
# we want to use it because keras is quite large.

library(readr)
library(data.table)
# library(keras)


```

Then, we can import the data.

```{r}
onlineShopperData <- fread("data/online_shoppers_intention.csv")
```


Pre-process the data

Build models identical to Sakar, but on our preprocessed version of the data

Compare results

Use oversampling

Reconstruct models

If time use SMOTE?

Significantly reduce the size of the training set
