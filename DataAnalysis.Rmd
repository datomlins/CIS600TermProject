Before doing any data analysis, we need to be able to import our data. To do 
that we need to install "readr". This will let us import the data from the csv.

```{r}
install.packages("readr")
library(readr)

' 
In case we use neural networks (we probably will). Not including because the
  library is quite large.
install.packages("keras")
install_keras()
library(keras)
'

```

Then, we can import the data.

```{r}
onlineShopperData <- read.csv("data/online_shoppers_intention.csv")
```


```{r}
onlineShopperData
```

*** TODO *** Write documentation for the data
*** TODO *** fix the file structure for an R project
